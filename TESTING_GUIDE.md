# ARP DoS via Gratuitous ARP Storm - Complete Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step testing process for the ARP DoS via Gratuitous ARP Storm lab environment.

## Prerequisites Testing

First, verify system requirements:

```bash
# Check if you have the required tools
./lab-manager.sh check
# or on Windows:
lab-manager.bat check
```

This checks for:
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Running Docker daemon
- At least 2GB RAM
- Administrative/root privileges

## Lab Environment Setup

### 1. Build the Lab Environment
```bash
# Build all containers from scratch
./lab-manager.sh build
```

### 2. Start the Lab
```bash
# Start the 4-container architecture
./lab-manager.sh start
```

This creates the isolated network with:
- **Attacker** (10.0.1.10): Attack tools container
- **Victim** (10.0.1.20): Target services container  
- **Observer** (10.0.1.30): Traffic monitoring container
- **Web Monitor** (10.0.1.40): Dashboard interface

### 3. Verify Lab Status
```bash
# Check all containers are running
./lab-manager.sh status
```

## Testing Attack Scenarios

### Basic Attack Testing

#### 1. Python-based ARP Storm Attack
```bash
# Run basic storm attack through lab manager
./lab-manager.sh attack basic

# Or manually access attacker container
docker-compose exec attacker /bin/bash
python arp_dos_storm.py --storm --subnet 10.0.1 --duration 60
```

#### 2. High-Performance C++ Attack
```bash
# Run intense attack scenario
./lab-manager.sh attack intense

# Or manually
docker-compose exec attacker ./arp_storm --subnet 10.0.1 --duration 30 --threads 4 --rate 500
```

#### 3. Targeted Poisoning Attack
```bash
# Run targeted attack
./lab-manager.sh attack poison

# Or manually
docker-compose exec attacker python arp_dos_storm.py --poison --targets 10.0.1.20 --gateway 10.0.1.1
```

## Monitoring and Analysis Testing

### 1. Real-time Web Dashboard
Access the monitoring interface:
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
- **Victim Services**: http://localhost:80

### 2. Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Access observer container for manual analysis
docker-compose exec observer /bin/bash
python arp_analyzer.py --duration 300 --output analysis.json

# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f observer
```

### 3. Network Reconnaissance Testing
From the `attacker_main.py` interactive menu:
```bash
docker-compose exec attacker python attacker_main.py
# Select option 6 for Network Reconnaissance
```

This tests:
- ARP table enumeration
- Network interface discovery
- Current network state analysis

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Interactive Attack Menu Testing
Access the full attack interface from `attacker_main.py`:
```bash
docker-compose exec attacker python attacker_main.py
```

Menu options include:
1. Basic ARP Storm Attack
2. Targeted Victim Poisoning
3. High-Intensity Storm
4. Continuous Low-Level Attack
5. Custom Attack Parameters
6. Network Reconnaissance
7. View System Status
8. View Attack Logs

### 2. Custom Parameter Testing
```bash
# Test with custom parameters
docker-compose exec attacker python arp_dos_storm.py --storm --subnet 10.0.1 --duration 30 --threads 8 --rate 200

# C++ high-performance testing
docker-compose exec attacker ./arp_storm --subnet 10.0.1 --duration 60 --threads 8 --rate 1000
```

### 3. Detection Algorithm Testing
Monitor attack detection from the `observer` container:
```bash
# Real-time analysis during attack
docker-compose exec observer python arp_analyzer.py --duration 120 &
./lab-manager.sh attack basic
```

## Performance Testing

### Attack Capability Testing
According to the README.md:
- **Python Tool**: Test ~1,000-5,000 packets/second
- **C++ Tool**: Test ~10,000-50,000 packets/second
- **Multi-threaded**: Scale with CPU cores
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor <100MB per container

### Monitoring Performance Testing
- **Real-time Analysis**: Verify <1 second latency
- **Detection Rate**: Test >95% accuracy
- **Dashboard Updates**: Check 1-second intervals

## Log Analysis and Results

### 1. View Live Logs
```bash
# All containers
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific container
./lab-manager.sh logs attacker
./lab-manager.sh logs observer
```

### 2. Export Results
```bash
# Export all logs, results, and captures
./lab-manager.sh export
```

This creates a timestamped archive with:
- Container logs
- Attack results
- Traffic captures
- Analysis reports

## Validation Testing

### 1. Attack Impact Verification
- Monitor victim container services during attacks
- Verify ARP table corruption on victim
- Check network connectivity disruption

### 2. Detection Accuracy Testing
- Verify observer correctly identifies attack patterns
- Test false positive rates with normal traffic
- Validate alert thresholds and detection algorithms

### 3. Mitigation Testing
Test defensive measures from README.md:
```bash
# Test rate limiting (example)
iptables -A INPUT -p arp -m limit --limit 10/sec -j ACCEPT

# Test static ARP entries
arp -s 10.0.1.1 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

## Network Architecture Testing

## Packet Analysis Testing

### Attack Packet Structure Validation

#### Ethernet Frame Structure (14 bytes)
```
Destination MAC (6 bytes): Target device MAC address
Source MAC (6 bytes):      Attacker MAC address  
EtherType (2 bytes):       0x0806 (ARP)
```

#### ARP Packet Structure (28 bytes)
```
Hardware Type (2 bytes):    0x0001 (Ethernet)
Protocol Type (2 bytes):    0x0800 (IPv4)
Hardware Length (1 byte):   6 (MAC length)
Protocol Length (1 byte):   4 (IP length)
Operation (2 bytes):        0x0002 (Reply)
Sender MAC (6 bytes):       Attacker MAC
Sender IP (4 bytes):        Spoofed IP
Target MAC (6 bytes):       Victim MAC
Target IP (4 bytes):        Target IP
```

## Detection Testing

### Detection Indicators to Verify
1. **High ARP Traffic**: Unusual volume of ARP packets
2. **Gratuitous ARP Ratio**: High percentage of gratuitous ARP
3. **MAC Address Changes**: Frequent IP-MAC mapping changes
4. **Unique Senders**: Unusually high number of different MAC addresses

### Detection Thresholds Testing
```python
thresholds = {
    'packets_per_second': 50,           # Normal: <10 ARP/sec
    'unique_senders_per_minute': 20,    # Normal: <5 senders/min
    'gratuitous_ratio': 0.7,            # Normal: <0.1 ratio
    'mac_changes_per_ip': 3             # Normal: 0-1 changes
}
```

## Troubleshooting Testing

### Common Issues to Test

**1. Permission Denied (Raw Sockets)**
```bash
# Ensure containers run with sufficient privileges
docker-compose up --privileged
```

**2. Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check for conflicting services
netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(80|8080)\s'

# Stop conflicting services or modify docker-compose.yml ports
```

**3. Container Build Failures**
```bash
# Clean rebuild
docker-compose down --rmi all
docker system prune -f
./lab-manager.sh build
```

**4. Network Connectivity Issues**
```bash
# Check Docker network
docker network ls
docker network inspect security_project_lab_network

# Reset network
docker-compose down
docker network prune
docker-compose up -d
```

### Debug Mode Testing
```bash
# Start with debug logging
DOCKER_COMPOSE_DEBUG=1 docker-compose up

# Access container for debugging
docker-compose exec attacker /bin/bash
```

## Safety and Legal Considerations for Testing

⚠️ **Critical Testing Guidelines**:
1. **Isolated Environment Only**: Test only within the Docker network
2. **Educational Purpose**: Use for learning and authorized research only
3. **Legal Compliance**: Never test on networks you don't own
4. **Controlled Parameters**: Start with minimal attack parameters
5. **Documentation**: Record all testing activities
